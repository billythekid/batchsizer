<p>Hi {{ $user->name }},</p>
<p>
    Thanks for using the email resizer. Please find attached your resized images for the settings:
    <code>{{ $sizes }}</code>
    </p>
<p>
    Remember that images are not upscaled using the email resizer so if your images were not as wide as your set widths to begin with there won't be an image for that width in the zip
    <br>Kind regards
